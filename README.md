In order to create those playbooks, I used several already existing playbooks and modified them:

* ssh configuration: [vitalk/ansible-secure-ssh](https://github.com/vitalk/ansible-secure-ssh "ansible-secure-ssh")
* raspi-config: [giuaig/ansible-raspi-config](https://github.com/giuaig/ansible-raspi-config "giuaig/ansible-raspi-config")
